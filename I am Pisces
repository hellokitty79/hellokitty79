- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rochelle
 Pisces are people with an average height and built,
 sometimes on the plumper side. They have large, full
 eyes, often peering into the distance. It is the only
 sign of the Zodiac which can take on many different 
 appearances. The eyes are often large, attractive, 
 quite fixed or slow, and almost hypnotic The whole
 physique gives an impression which is somehow misty,
 mysterious, benevolent and quiet. Their physical
 demeanour has a ring of mystery about it, which is
 very difficult to classify, but one thing it does
 radiate is benevolence.
